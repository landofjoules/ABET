Could you bring a copy of the Abet Form?

For each professor, what are the constraints for each:
    Course
    Outcome per course
    Performance indicator per outcome
    Rubric per indicator

What are all the pages we need to make? - Review
Do you think we will need anything other than the netid, or should we use a hash key or something?

 ~ GENERAL PLAN ~
We need to make a basic layout soon so we have room to tweak. and adjust
Ideally the project should be done by April 13, most likely April 20th.
Then we can begin testing



 ~ ROLES ~
This week harry will find out how to connect to the web page to the ut authentication system,
    and pass the netid or whatever neccesary keys as a session variable.
    
Andrew will add professor information to the models,
    and he and I will make views pass in correct query information
    [ we either use ajax
